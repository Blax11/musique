This is a 100% Java audio player that supports most popular formats

    * MP3
    * MP4
    * OGG
    * FLAC
    * WavPack
    * APE
    * WAV, AU, AIFF

note: MP4 support is done through JNI and libfaad2, (32-bit JRE's only)

There is also built in support for CUE files and gapless playback

Compiling

    To compile, run ant -f musique.xml or open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
    Community Edition

    Requirements: Sun JDK 1.6, or OpenJDK 1.6

    Then run either musique.sh or musique.bat

Reading and Editing Tags notes

    Currently non-unicode tags are read as windows1251 (Cyrillic), I'll add settings
    dialog for that later

    Writing tags for CUE files is also not supported

Title formatting help:

    Everything is pretty much winamp/foobar2000 style:
    Currently the following tags are supported:

    %artist%, %title%, %album%, %year%, %genre%, %comment%, %length% - Don't need to explain these
    %albumArtist% - Album Artist, for MP3 I use album artist from TXXX, fb2k style
    %fileName% - filename without extension
    %filePath% - full file path
    %trackNumber%, %totalTracks% - track number and total tracks
    %tracknumber% - (lower-case 'n') returns track number formatted as a two-digit number
    %track% - convenience method that returns trackNumber/totalTrack, eg. 1/12
    %discNumber%, %totalDiscs% - disc number and total discs
    %codec% - returns codec (mp3, FLAC, WavPack, Ogg Vorbis, Monkey's Audio, PCM)

    you can also use some technical info fields like
    %bitrate%, %totalSamples%, %songIndex%, %sampleRate%

    You can also use some functions, but not many of them are implemented yet:
    $if1(arg1, arg2, arg3) - returns arg2 if arg1 is not empty, and arg3 otherwise
    $if3(arg1, arg2, ...) - returns first non-empty argument
    $strcmp(arg1, arg2) - returns 1 if arg1=arg2, empty string otherwise
    $isPlaying() - used to idicate that the song is currently playing, paused or in playback queue

    '' - Regular strings are enclosed in single quotation marks
    [arg1 arg2] - will return contents only if at least on of the args is not empty

    Some sample usages:

    $if1($strcmp('mp3', %codec%),'this is mp3','hurray to free formats')
        will compare field 'codec' with string 'mp3', and return 'this is mp3' if they are equal

    [%artist% - ]%title% - returns 'Artist - Title' if artist field is not empty,
        otherwise returns just 'Title'

    $if3(%title%, %fileName%) - returns file name without extension if title is empty

    $if3(%albumArtist%, %artist%)\%year%\%album%%discNumber%%tracknumber%%title%%fileName%
        I use this expression to sort my collection


Performance Notes

    I've tested the program in Windows 7 on Core 2 Duo 2.13 GHz, JRE 1.6u20 32-bit
    and average CPU load was less than 1. Memory consumption was around 60-70 Mb

    When I run the program in Ubuntu 10.04 32-bit and OpenJDK 1.6, memory consumption
    is also around 60-70Mb, but the CPU load is 4%.
    However, deadbeef and rhytmbox use same amount of CPU so I suspect it's because of
    PulseAudio.

    I've tested it with 64bit OpenJDK and memory usage was 100Mb and CPU load also 4%
    Rhytmbox and deadbeef use less than 1%. So I don't know why it's slow.
    I can't test it on Sun JRE now.
